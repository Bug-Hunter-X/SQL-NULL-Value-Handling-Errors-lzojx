In SQL, a common oversight is neglecting to handle NULL values appropriately.  For instance, using the `=` operator to compare a column to NULL will always return false, even if the column contains a NULL value.  This is because NULL represents the absence of a value, not a specific value.  Another issue arises with aggregate functions such as `AVG()` or `SUM()` applied to columns containing NULLs; these functions often ignore NULLs, leading to inaccurate results if not accounted for.
