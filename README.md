This repository demonstrates common errors related to handling NULL values in SQL queries, specifically focusing on the issues encountered when using the `=` operator for NULL comparison and aggregate functions on columns with NULLs.  The `bug.sql` file contains examples of problematic queries, while `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected versions using `IS NULL` and `COALESCE` to handle NULLs appropriately.
